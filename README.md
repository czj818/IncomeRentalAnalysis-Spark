# Using PySpark and Sparksql to Explore the Income and Rental Price Datasets

## Motivation

The quality and happiness of living in a certain geographical place are related to the proportion of rent over monthly income. The less the ratio is, the more people can spend on their interest. In this project, I will discover the relationship between household income and the rental price in different counties over the United States. Does a higher household income in a county lead to a higher rental price in that county? I will explore the US income dataset and rental price dataset using Pyspark to find out the average rental price per county and average household income. Besides, I will rank the top10 county with the highest rent-income ratio.

## Research Question
- Which county is the most expensive to live in according to the average rental price?
- Does the top five highest rental price counties have corresponding highest incomes?
- Which county has the worst cost performance in the aspect of rent?
